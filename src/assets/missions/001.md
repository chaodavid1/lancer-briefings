> Alright, listen up. On 6.24.5017u, contact was lost with the Omninet Relay Outpost R10-981, located within an asteroid belt around the Sharbāt system, and locals reported the ceasing of all signals from the station. A nearby UBO/NTM Maintenance Vessel en-route to a colonial satellite was diverted to provide assistance, but signal didn't return and they never reached their destination. We've got no idea what we're flying into, and by the time we get there, it'll be over two and a half weeks since it went dark. Could be anything from pirates to a cascading NHP or all sorts of other unknown phenomenon. We'll be sending you in on the subline transport ship while we hang back in orbit awaiting a call for extract. Suit up, Rangers.
