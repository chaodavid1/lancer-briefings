> On 6.24.5017u, contact was lost with the Omninet Relay Outpost R10-981, located within an asteroid belt around the Sharbāt system. Nearby vessals reported the halting of all signals coming from the station. A nearby UBO/NTM Maintenance Vessel en-route to a colonial satellite was diverted to provide assistance, but signal did not return. On 7.12.5017u, the adjusted ETA of the UBO/NTM Maintenance Vessel, the colonial satellite reported no sign of them, leading to the deployment of a FFT ship equipped with mechanized chassis to investigate. Suit up, Rangers.
